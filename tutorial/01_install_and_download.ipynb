    "1. How to know the path of a specific file or folder\n",
    "2. How to write the path in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. How to know the path of a specific file or folder\n",
    "There are several ways to know the path, some of them depend on the Operating System you are using (Windows, Linux, Mac, ...).\n",
    "Typically, when using a file manager software (e.g. File Explorer in Windows) the path is reported just below the menus. \n",
    "To be used in Python, you need to obtain the textual version of the path, for instance double-clicking on the path, or similar actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, you will need to copy (Ctrl-C) a text like these (within the `' '`):\n",
    "\n",
    "* `'C:\\Users\\User\\data'` [on Windows]\n",
    "* `'/home/user/data'` [on Linux]\n",
    "* `'/Users/user/data'` [on Mac]\n",
    "\n",
    "Please, find how to retrieve the path of files or folders on your system and familiarize with the methods before continuing with this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. How to write the path in Python\n",
    "Typically, the path can be just copied directly in the Python code.\n",
    "E.g., to save the path in a variable called `DATA_DIR`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`DATA_DIR = '/home/user/data'`\n",
    "\n",
    "However, Windows users should be careful about the correct _separator_ they need to use to compose path to be compatible with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Be careful about differences between `/`  and `\\`. Path in Windows use the `\\` which is not valid in Python.\n",
    "* You can substitute `\\` with `/`: `'C:\\Users\\User\\data'` --> `'C:/Users/User/data'`\n",
    "* Or you can double the `/`: `'C:\\Users\\User\\data'` --> `'C:\\\\Users\\\\User\\\\data'`\n",
    "\n",
    "See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2953834/windows-path-in-python) help page for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also need to concatenate paths, for instance to refer to a folder which is contained in a folder with a specific path.\n",
    "To this aim we will use the `os.path.join` function, which will make sure the correct separator is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance to refer to the `original` folder contained in the `DATA_DIR`:\n",
